Basic Features (DAO Methods)
Feature 1 – Get all Entities (assuming Player entities in this example)
e.g. List<Player> getAllPlayers() - return a List of all the entities and display the
returned list.


Feature 2 – Find and Display (a single) Entity by Key
e.g. Player getPlayerById(id ) – return a single entity (DTO) and display its
contents.


Feature 3 – Delete an Entity by key
e.g. deletePlayerById(id) – remove specified entity from database


Feature 4 – Insert an Entity
(gather data, instantiate a Player object, pass into DAO method for insertion in
DB) e.g. Player insertPlayer(Player p)


return new entity (Player DTO) that includes the assigned auto-id.
Feature 5 – Update an existing Entity by ID using supplied Player object
e.g. updatePlayer(int id, Player p) – executes specified updates


Feature 6 – Get list of entities matching a filter (based on DTO object)
e.g. List<Player> findPlayersApplyFilter( playerAgeComparator )


4. Create two methods (in a JsonConverter Class) that will convert data into JSON
format:

Feature 7 - Convert List of Entities to a JSON String
e.g. String playersListToJsonString( List<Player> list )

Feature 8 – Convert a single Entity by Key into a JSON String
e.g. String playerToJsonString( Player p )
